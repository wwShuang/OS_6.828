<p>(result is a little differenet with tutorial)</p>
<p>The following line:</p>
<pre><code>[f000:fff0]    0xffff0:	ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b
</code></pre>
<p>is GDBâ€™s disassembly of the first instruction to be executed. From this output you can conclude a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IBM PC starts executing at physical address 0x000ffff0, which is at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS.(below 1MB)</li>
<li>The PC starts executing with  CS = 0xf000  and  IP = 0xfff0.</li>
<li>The first instruction to be executed is a  jmp  instruction, which jumps to the segmented address  CS = 0xf000  and  IP = 0xe05b.</li>
</ul>
